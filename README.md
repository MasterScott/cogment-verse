[Cogment](https://cogment.ai) is an innovative open source AI platform designed to leverage the advent of AI to benefit humankind through human-AI collaboration developed by [AI Redefined](https://ai-r.com). Cogment enables AI researchers and engineers to build, train and operate AI agents in simulated or real environments shared with humans. For the full user documentation visit <https://docs.cogment.ai>

ðŸš§ This repository is under construction, it'll propose a library of environments and agent implementations to get started with Human In the Loop Learning (HILL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Cogment in minutes. Cogment Verse is designed both for practionners discovering the field as well as for experienced researchers or engineers as an framework to develop and benchmark new approaches.

## Environments

The initial version of Cogment Verse will include environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) and [Petting Zoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml) featuring the classic control tasks, Atari games as well as multi player cooperative and competitive games.

## Human actors

The initial version of Cogment Verse will include several web-based interfaces to let humans provide demonstration trajectories or play alongside agents.

## Agent implementations & training methods

The initial version of Cogment Verse will include a collection of state of the art reinforcement learning agent implementations either training on their own, through self play or alongside human actors.

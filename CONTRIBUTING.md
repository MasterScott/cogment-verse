1. You want to propose a new feature and implement it.

   - Post about your intended feature in an [issue](https://github.com/cogment/cogment-verse/issues), and we shall discuss the design and implementation. Once we agree that the plan looks good, go ahead and implement it.

2. You want to implement a feature or bugfix for an outstanding issue.

   - Search for your issue in the [Cogment Verse issue list](https://github.com/cogment/cogment-verse/issues).
   - Pick an issue and comment that you'd like to work on the feature or bug fix.
   - If you need more context on a particular issue, let's talk!

## CLA

Whenever a non-Airite (i.e. someone not working at [AI Redefined](https://ai-r.com) wants to submit a patch to a Cogment open source project, they must first sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This allows the contributor to retain their ownership in the code submitted while granting Artificial Intelligence Redefined the necessary legal rights to use that contribution. The CLA only needs to be signed once, and it covers all Cogment projects.

To obtain and sign a CLA, please email <dev+cla@ai-r.com>.

## Discord

Cogment users and developers are welcome to exchange on our Discord server. This is also the perfect place to get in touch with the team.

Here's an invite list for this server: <https://discord.gg/jVfHVzdYVF>

## Reporting a bug

### Security disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Any security issues should be submitted directly to <dev+security@ai-r.com>. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at <dev+security@ai-r.com>.

### Filing a bug report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of cogment are you using (`cogment version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Issues should be filed on [github](https://github.com/cogment/cogment-verse/issues). General questions should go to our [discord server](#discord) instead of the issue tracker. The Airites there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.
